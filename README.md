  <h2>Problem</h2>
  <p>
    On macOS, everything I download from the Internet will land on the Downloads folder.
  </p>
  <p>
    After a while, this folder becomes a mess of all file types that I may or may not need.
    Although I am using Raycast (Apple Spotlight on steroid), scraping through such a mess for files,
    especially new ones is hugely time-consuming.
  </p>

  <h2>Solution requirements</h2>
  <p>With the above pain point, I need a solution to:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>Cleanup my Downloads folder periodically (ideally every day) so whenever there is a newly downloaded file, I can spot them right away.</li>
    <li>Keep an archive of all the old files, well, just in case.</li>
  </ol>

  <h2>Introducing: File Organizer (FO)</h2>
  <p><em>(Excuse my poor naming attempt, this app is not for commercial distribution yet!)</em></p>

  <h3>What does it do?</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>(With minimal setup) FO will run periodically (set by you) to bring all the files of the same type into the same folder.</li>
  </ul>
