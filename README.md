# file-optimization
<h1>Problem<h1>
On macOS, everything I download from the Internet will land on the Downloads folder.

After a while, this folder becomes a mess of all file types that I may or may not need. Although I am using Raycast (Apple Spotlight on steroid), scraping through such a mess for files, especially new ones is hugely time-consuming
Solution requirements
With the above pain point, I need a solution to:

Cleanup my Downloads folder periodically (ideally every day) so whenever there is a newly downloaded file, I can spot them right away.
Keep an archive of all the old files, well, just in case.
